# QuoteGenerator - Javascript

After doing these app on React, now i'm doing the same app with pure Javascript Vainilla using this [API](https://type.fit/api/quotes).-

When the content of the DOM loads, it makes an api query and returns the results to an array. It also obtains a random quote from that array and displays it on the screen. When the user clicks the button, he gets a random quote again from the array and sample it.

The objective was to practice pure JS with a simple and very small proyect doing it with and without a library.-
